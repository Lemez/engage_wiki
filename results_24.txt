following the success of Four, they had hopes to continue to go \"somewhere else\" on their fifth album.","One Direction's debut studio album, Up All Night (2011), is predominantly a pop music record, containing elements of teen pop, dance-pop, pop rock, with electropop and rock influences.","Digital Spy's Robert Copsey described the album as a \"collection of PG pop rock with killer choruses\", while The New York Times considered it \"full of easy rock-inflected pop, blithe and sometimes clever.\" Jason Lipshutz of Billboard acknowledged that the album demonstrates an originality in sound that was \"necessary for the revitalization of the boy band movement\".","The songs \"One Thing\" and \"What Makes You Beautiful\" were particularly noted for the genres of power pop and pop rock, for their \"powerhouse\" guitar riffs and \"forceful\" choruses.","Their second studio album, Take Me Home (2012), is characterised by rock-inherited pop, prominent electric guitar riffs, bright synthesisers, a homogeneous sound and message, and the pitch-correcting software Auto-Tune.","Alexis Petridis of The Guardian interpreted its signature sound as a \"peppy, synth-bolstered take on early-80s new-wave pop, heavy on clipped rhythms and chugging guitars,\" which, he said, is at least an improvement on the substitute contemporary R\u0026B \"that was once the grim lot of the boyband.\" Jon Caramanica, writing in The New York Times, considered the album \"far more mechanical\" than their debut album, although noted that it is sonically and lyrically similar.","The album's lyricism speaks of falling in love, unrequited love, the insistence that flaws are what make a person unique, commitment, jealousy and longing for past significant others.","Erica Futterman for Rolling Stone favoured their live acoustic performances as both showing, \"Horan's ability to play guitar, as well as One Direction's admirable live vocals. There was no need to worry about a backing track or a bum note, a pleasant realization at a pop show.\" Herald Sun '​s Cameron Adams opined that One Direction have \"strong pop voices\".","Melody Lau of the National Post wrote, \"It's easy to get lost in inherent appeal of their perfectly coiffed dos and almost-too-put-together preppy style but somewhere in the midst of all the love-struck squeals of teenage girls are guys who can actually sing and, to a certain extent, entertain.\" Jane Stevenson of the portal site Canoe concurred: \"What I didn't really prepare myself for was that they all can actually sing in concert.\" Chris Richards, writing in The Washington Post, dissented from the approval: \"As the five traded couplets, it was tough to imagine a future Justin Timberlake, Ricky Martin or Bobby Brown emerging from the pack. No one voice stood out.\" Mike Wass of Idolator felt One Direction's \"surprisingly accomplished effort\" of Kings of Leon's \"Use Somebody\" proved that One Direction are \"more than capable\" of evolving their sound.","Their third album Midnight Memories (2013) is a pop rock record, a slight departure from the band's original teen pop sound.","Liam Payne called Midnight Memories a \"slightly rockier and edgier\" album than their previous material.","The album is heavily influenced by 80's rock and folk music and briefly integrates elements of dubstep, notably in \"Little White Lies\".","The album's lyrical themes primarily revolve around love, heartbreak and sexual intercourse.","Many critics praised its lyrical depth and musical composition, as well as the group's level of involvement in the production process.","Their fourth album Four (2014) was released on 17 November 2014.","Payne once again claimed that the album would be \"edgier\" and that the group had written most of the songs for it; Horan came up with the name of the album, commemorating the fact that it is One Direction's fourth record to date and that it has been four years since the band's formation.","Signifying a further maturation of their pop sound, the album's first single, Steal My Girl, was dubbed by Billboard as \"no What Makes You Beautiful, but its Coldplay-like piano pop could be a good direction\", and that the band was \"not entirely ready to let go of its bubble-gum days\".","Rolling Stone described the record as \"saturated with retro vibes\"; its songs \"split the difference between big, splashy Eighties pop rock and more elegant Seventies flavours - a very millennial move that's not so far from what Haim's hit Days Are Gone did last year.","In 2011, the band performed on the BBC's Children in Need 2011 broadcast, helping raise over 26 million pounds.","In 2012 they extended their involvement with Children in Need as they opened the telecast with a performance of their single \"Live While We're Young\".","The group said it was \"incredible\" to be involved in the charity event as it was something that they had \"always watched as children\".","In February 2013, One Direction released a medley of \"One Way or Another\" and \"Teenage Kicks\", \"One Way or Another (Teenage Kicks)\", as the 2013 Comic Relief single.","For ITV's Santa charity Christmas campaign, they filmed a set of pleas to their fans and the general public, asking them to donate £2.","In September 2012, Niall Horan organised an event to raise money for Irish Autism Action and another charity, called Temporary Emergency Accommodation Mullingar, based in his hometown.","Due to overwhelming demand to participate in the fundraising, the ticket website for the event broke down.","Horan's brother Greg commented on the website crash, saying that \"there were 500 tickets and they were all snapped up pretty quick\".","Horan later reflected on the fundraisings saying that he was \"honoured to be able to give back to his community\".","In 2013, band members Liam Payne and Harry Styles partnered with Trekstock, a leading cancer charity in order to help raise money for cancer research.","As ambassadors of the charity, the duo collaborated to offer the chance for one fan and a friend to win an evening out with them in return for a donation to the charity as part of an exclusive \"#HangwithLiam\u0026Harry\" global campaign.","They had originally set a goal of raising $500,000 and ended up raising $784,984.","Trekstock later added that this amount would allow them to \"complete funding of their Hodgkin's lymphoma trial, in the hope of offering a much brighter future to thousands of children and young people affected by this form of disease.\" One Direction were named the most charitable in 2013 behind Taylor Swift by social change organization DoSomething.","org.","In 2014, One Direction donated £600,000 for the Stand up to Cancer campaign by giving portions of their ticket sales revenues from their Where We Are Tour.","On 15 November 2014, One Direction joined the charity group Band Aid 30 along with other British and Irish pop acts, recording the latest version of the track \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\" at Sarm West Studios in Notting Hill, London, to raise money for the 2014 Ebola crisis in Western Africa.","Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph, in an article on One Direction's success in North America, notes that Americans had left a gap in the market and it took the prominence of Justin Bieber to demonstrate that there still was a market for \"clean cut, wholesome, whiter-than-white, middle class parent friendly pop: cute boys advocating puppy love. And what could be better than one cute boy, if not five?\" One Direction have been described as sparking a resurgence in the interest in boy bands, and as forming part of a new \"British Invasion\" in the United States.","Bill Werde, a representative of Billboard magazine, commented, \"There's a lot of possibility here, there's a lot of upside, that level of talent with those kinds of looks, it's really a perfect storm for a massive, massive successful phenomenon.\" One Direction are safe and sound due to the faithful bodyguard Alberto Alvarez who was Micheal Jackson's former logistics director.","Sonny Takhar, the chief executive officer of Syco Records, attributes the breakthrough to the power of social media.","\"Sometimes you feel the song's the star, but it's not like that here – it's the act,\" he said.","\"It's a real moment. Social media has become the new radio, it's never broken an act globally like this before.\" Will Bloomfield, the group's manager, added, \"These guys live online, and so do their fans.\" Their management employs a social media team and the members all tweet themselves, \"which helps create the illusion that they couldn't be any closer to their fans,\" according to Caspar Llewellyn Smith, writing for The Guardian.","One Direction's Twitter account had amassed 10 million followers by February 2013, with the account gaining followers at an average of 21,000 per day.","In an approached pioneered by The Beatles each member is known for his feature; Horan is \"the cute one\", Malik is \"the quiet and mysterious one\", Payne is \"the sensible one\", Styles is \"the charming one\" and Tomlinson is \"the funny one\".","Horan commented on One Direction as a boy band, \"People think that a boy band is air-grabs and [being] dressed in all one colour. We're boys in a band. We're trying to do something different from what people would think is the typical kind of boy band. We're trying to do different kinds of music and we're just trying to be ourselves, not squeaky clean.\" Leah Collins, writing for the National Post, remarked that One Direction had succeeded on the latter front, \"For the most part, that just means the group presents themselves as typical, goofy and uncensored teenage boys – posting jokey YouTube videos, for instance, or boozing at awards shows.\" Writing for The Observer, Kitty Empire opined, \"One Direction fulfil a great many boy band prerequisites (looks, soppy lyrics, tune-grasp, fame-lust) but their lack of routines points to the subtle digressions afoot here\".","One Direction have been recipients of two BRIT Awards—winning their first with \"What Makes You Beautiful\" for Best British Single at the 2012 BRIT Awards, three

So, I kept thinking to myself, I need to figure out a way to be different.\" At the age of twelve, Swift was taught how to play three chords on a guitar, inspiring her to write her first song, \"Lucky You.\" She had previously won a national poetry contest with a poem titled \"Monster in My Closet,\" but now began to focus on songwriting.","In 2003, Swift and her parents started working with New York-based music manager Dan Dymtrow.","With Dymtrow's help, Swift modelled for Abercrombie \u0026 Fitch as part of their \"Rising Stars\" campaign, had an original song included in a Maybelline compilation CD, and attended meetings with major record labels.","After performing original songs at an RCA Records showcase, the eighth-grader was given an artist development deal and began making frequent trips to Nashville with her mother.","My parents took all the pressure off by saying, \"We're just moving because we love the area, so don't worry.\" They knew nothing about the industry and had no involvement in entertainment, but I was obsessed with it and so they did their research and read up about it to help me in every way they could.","They're amazing people.","In Tennessee, Swift attended Hendersonville High School for her freshman and sophomore years.","Later, to accommodate her touring schedule, Swift transferred to the Aaron Academy, a private Christian school which offered homeschooling services.","She earned her high school diploma in 2008, having completed her final two years of course work in 12 months.","Swift moved to Nashville, Tennessee, at the age of 14.","In 2004, she signed an artist development deal with RCA Records, leading to writing sessions with experienced Music Row songwriters such as Troy Verges, Brett Beavers, Brett James, Mac McAnally and The Warren Brothers.","She eventually formed a lasting working relationship with Liz Rose.","Swift saw Rose performing at an RCA songwriter event and suggested that they write together.","They began meeting for two-hour writing sessions every Tuesday afternoon after school.","Rose has said that the sessions were \"some of the easiest I've ever done. Basically, I was just her editor. She'd write about what happened in school that day. She had such a clear vision of what she was trying to say. And she'd come in with the most incredible hooks.\" Swift also began recording demos with producer Nathan Chapman.","After performing at a BMI Songwriter's Circle showcase at The Bitter End, New York, in 2004, Swift became the youngest songwriter ever hired by the Sony/ATV Tree publishing house.","Swift left RCA Records when she was 15—the company wanted her to record the work of other songwriters and wait until she was eighteen to release an album, but she felt ready to launch her career with her own material.","Swift later recalled: \"I genuinely felt that I was running out of time. I wanted to capture these years of my life on an album while they still represented what I was going through.\" She also parted ways with manager Dan Dymtrow, who later took legal action against Swift and her parents.","In 2010, a judge nullified six of Dymtrow's legal claims.","The remaining unjust-enrichment claim was settled out of court.","At an industry showcase at Nashville's Bluebird Cafe in 2005, Swift caught the attention of Scott Borchetta, a DreamWorks Records executive who was preparing to form his own independent record label, Big Machine Records.","She became one of the label's first signings, with her father purchasing a three per cent stake in the fledgling company at an estimated cost of $120,000.","As an introduction to the country music business, Borchetta arranged for Swift to intern as an artist escort at the CMA Music Festival.","Swift began working on her eponymous debut album shortly after signing her record deal.","After experimenting with veteran Nashville producers, Swift persuaded Big Machine to hire her demo producer Nathan Chapman.","It was his first time recording a studio album but Swift felt they had the right \"chemistry.\" Swift wrote three of the album's songs alone, including two singles, and co-wrote the remaining eight with a team of writers including Rose, Robert Ellis Orrall and Angelo Petraglia.","Musically, the album has been described as \"a mix of trad-country instruments and spry rock guitars.","Taylor Swift was released on October 24, 2006.","The New York Times described it as \"a small masterpiece of pop-minded country, both wide-eyed and cynical, held together by Ms. Swift's firm, pleading voice.\" The New Yorker's Sasha Frere-Jones described the sixteen-year-old Swift as a \"prodigy.\" He noted that \"Our Song\" \"stop[ped] me in my tracks\" and praised the lyrics: \"He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel, the other on my heart.\" Rolling Stone described Swift as \"bright-eyed but remarkably seasoned,\" and admired \"Our Song\"'s \"insanely hooky sing-song melody that's as Britney as it is Patsy.","Big Machine Records was still in its infancy upon the release of the lead single \"Tim McGraw\" in June 2006, and Swift and her mother helped \"stuff the CD singles into envelopes to send to radio.\" She spent much of 2006 promoting Taylor Swift in a radio tour and later commented, \"Radio tours for most artists last six weeks. Mine lasted six months.\" Swift baked cookies and painted canvases to gift to radio station programmers who played her music.","She made many television appearances, including on the Grand Ole Opry, Good Morning America, and TRL.","Swift, a self-described \"kid of the internet,\" used Myspace to build a fanbase.","This was, at the time, \"revolutionary in country music.\" Borchetta has said that his decision to sign a 16-year-old singer-songwriter initially raised eyebrows among his record industry peers but Swift tapped into a previously unknown market: teenage girls who listen to country music.","Following \"Tim McGraw\", four further singles were released throughout 2007 and 2008: \"Teardrops on My Guitar\", \"Our Song\", \"Picture to Burn\" and \"Should've Said No\".","All were highly successful on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart, with \"Our Song\" and \"Should've Said No\" both reaching number one.","\"Our Song\" made Swift the youngest person to single-handedly write and sing a number-one country song.","\"Teardrops on My Guitar\" became a minor pop hit; it reached number thirteen on the Billboard Hot 100.","The album sold 39,000 copies during its first week of release and, as of March 2011, had sold over 5.","5 million copies worldwide.","Swift also released a holiday album, Sounds of the Season: The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection, in October 2007, and an EP, Beautiful Eyes, in July 2008.","Swift toured extensively in support of Taylor Swift.","In addition to her own material, Swift played covers of songs by Beyoncé, Rihanna, John Waite, Lynyrd Skynyrd and Eminem.","She conducted meet-and-greet sessions with fans before and after her concerts—these lasted for up to four hours.","As well as festival and theater dates, Swift performed as an opening act for several country artists' concert tours.","In late 2006, she opened for Rascal Flatts on the final nine dates of their Me \u0026 My Gang Tour, after the previous supporting act Eric Church was fired.","Swift later sent Church her first gold record with a note: \"Thanks for playing 'too long' and 'too loud' on the Flatts tour. I sincerely appreciate it. Taylor.\" In 2007, she served as the opening act on twenty dates for George Strait's tour, several dates on Kenny Chesney's Flip-Flop Summer Tour, selected dates on Brad Paisley's Bonfires \u0026 Amplifiers Tour and several dates for Tim McGraw and Hill's joint Soul2Soul II Tour.","Swift again opened for Rascal Flatts on their Still Feels Good Tour in 2008.","Swift and Alan Jackson were jointly named the Nashville Songwriters Association's Songwriter/Artist of the Year in 2007, with Swift becoming the youngest person ever to be honored with the title.","She also won the Country Music Association's Horizon Award for Best New Artist, the Academy of Country Music Awards's Top New Female Vocalist award and the American Music Awards's Favorite Country Female Artist honor.","She was also nominated for a 2008 Grammy Award in the category of Best New Artist, but lost to Amy Winehouse.","Swift's second studio album, Fearless, was released on November 11, 2008.","Swift wrote seven of the album's songs alone, including two singles, and co-wrote the remaining six with songwriters Rose, John Rich, Colbie Caillat and Hillary Lindsey.","She co-produced the album with Nathan Chapman.","Musically, it has been said that the record is characterized by \"loud, lean guitars and rousing choruses,\" with the occasional \"bit of fiddle and banjo tucked into the mix.","The New York Times described Swift as \"one of pop's finest songwriters, country's foremost pragmatist and more in touch with her inner life than most adults.\" The Village Voice felt she displayed \"preternatural wisdom and inclusiveness,\" \"masterfully avoiding the typical diarist's pitfalls of trite banality and pseudo-profound bullshit.\" Rolling Stone described her as \"a songwriting savant with an intuitive gift for verse-chorus-bridge architecture\" whose \"squirmingly intimate and true\" songs seemed to be \"literally ripped from a suburban girl's diary.\" Music critic Robert Christgau characterized Swift as \"an uncommonly-to-impossibly strong and gifted teenage girl.","Swift, who now owned her own management company led by Robert Allen, promoted Fearless heavily upon its release.","An episode of The Ellen DeGeneres Show was dedicated to the album launch and Swift appeared on many other chat shows.","She communicated with fans using social media platforms such as Twitter and personal video blogs and co-hosted the pre-show for the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards.","The lead single from the album, \"Love Story\", was released in September 2008 and became the second-best-selling country single of all time, peaking at number four on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.","Four more singles were released throughout 2008 and 2009: \"White Horse\", \"You Belong with Me\", \"Fifteen\" and \"Fearless\".","\"You Belong with Me\" was the album's highest-charting single, peaking at number two on the Billboard Hot 100.","The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 Album Chart with sales of 592,304, and has since sold over 8.","6 million copies worldwide.","It was the top-selling album of 2009 and brought Swift much crossover success.","Swift went on her first headlining tour in support of Fearless.","As part of the 105-date Fearless Tour, Swift played 90 dates in North America, six dates in Europe, eight dates in Australia and one date in Asia.","She sang a cover of Justin Timberlake's \"What Goes Around...

It's not something I feel like we need to keep talking about.\" It has been said that the incident and subsequent media attention turned Swift into \"a bona-fide mainstream celebrity.","Swift won four Grammy Awards in 2010, from a total of eight nominations.","Fearless was named Album of the Year and Best Country Album, while \"White Horse\" was named Best Country Song and Best Female Country Vocal Performance.","She was the youngest ever artist to win Album of the Year.","During the 2010 Grammy Awards ceremony, Swift sang \"Rhiannon\" and \"You Belong with Me\" with Stevie Nicks.","Her vocal performance received negative reviews and sparked a widespread media backlash.","Her vocals were described variously as \"badly off-key,\" \"strikingly bad\" and \"incredibly wretched.\" While The New York Times found it \"refreshing to see someone so gifted make the occasional flub\" and described Swift as \"the most important new pop star of the past few years,\" music analyst Bob Lefsetz predicted that her career would end \"overnight.\" He publicly appealed to Swift's father to hire a \"crisis publicity agent\" to manage the story because \"Taylor's too young and dumb to understand the mistake she made.","Taylor reminds me of myself in her determination and her childlike nature.","It's an innocence that's so special and so rare.","This girl writes the songs that make the whole world sing, like Neil Diamond or Elton John .","The female rock-'n'-roll-country-pop songwriter is back, and her name is Taylor Swift.","And it's women like her who are going to save the music business.","Fearless won many other accolades and has become the most-awarded album in country music history.","Swift became the youngest ever artist and one of only six women to be named Entertainer

Influential People in 2010.","Swift released her third studio album, Speak Now, on October 25, 2010.","She wrote all 14 songs alone and co-produced the record with longtime collaborator Chapman.","Musically, it has been said that the album \"expands beyond country-pop to border both alternative rock and dirty bubblegum pop.","The New York Times described the album as savage, musically diverse and \"excellent too, possibly her best.\" The Village Voice remarked that the album demanded \"a true appreciation of Swift's talent, which is not confessional, but dramatic: Like a procession of country songwriters before her, she creates characters and situations—some from life—and finds potent ways to describe them.\" Music critic Robert Christgau found the album's songs \"overlong and overworked\" but remarked that \"they evince an effort that bears a remarkable resemblance to care—that is, to caring in the best, broadest, and most emotional sense.\" Rolling Stone described Swift as one of the best songwriters in \"pop, rock or country\": \"Swift might be a clever Nashville pro who knows all the hitmaking tricks, but she's also a high-strung, hyper-romantic gal with a melodramatic streak the size of the Atchafalaya Swamp.","Swift carried out an extensive promotional campaign prior to Speak Now's release.","She appeared on various talk shows and morning shows, and gave free mini-concerts in unusual locations, including an open-decker bus on Hollywood Boulevard and a departure lounge at JFK airport.","She took part in a \"guitar pull\" alongside Kris

performed many acoustic cover versions during her North American tour.","In each city, she paid tribute to a homegrown artist.","She said the cover versions allowed her to be \"spontaneous\" in an otherwise well-rehearsed show.","The tour was attended by over 1.","6 million fans and grossed over $123 million.","Swift's first live album, Speak Now World Tour: Live, featuring all seventeen performances from the North American leg of the tour, was released in November 2011.","At the 54th Annual Grammy Awards, Swift's song \"Mean\" won Best Country Song and Best Country Solo Performance.","She also performed the song during the ceremony.","Lefsetz, one of the most vocal critics of her 2010 Grammy performance, believes the song is addressed to him.","Lefsetz had previously been a supporter of the singer's career, and Swift and Lefsetz had corresponded occasionally by email and telephone.","Time felt she \"delivered her comeback on-key and with a vengeance\" while USA Today remarked that the criticism in 2010 seemed to have \"made her a better songwriter and live performer.","Swift won various other awards for Speak Now.","She was named Songwriter/Artist of the Year by the Nashville Songwriters Association in both 2010 and 2011.","She was named Entertainer of the Year by the Academy of Country Music in both 2011 and 2012, and was named Entertainer of the

served as the album's lead producer but Jeff Bhasker, Butch Walker, Jacknife Lee, Dann Huff and Shellback also produced individual tracks.","Chapman said he encouraged Swift \"to branch out and to test herself in other situations.","Musically, while there is experimentation with heartland rock, dubstep and dance-pop, it is \"sprinkled among more recognisably Swiftian fare.\" Jon Caramanica of The New York Times found Red \"less detailed and more rushed than her usual fare\" but placed it at number two on his end-of-year list, characterizing it as the album on which Swift \"stops pretending she's anything but a pop megastar, one with grown-up concerns, like how two bodies speak to each other and how taste in records can be a stand-in for moral turpitude.\" The Times praised her \"sublime\" lyrics, particularly those on the \"brooding\" \"All Too Well\".","Rolling Stone enjoyed \"watching Swift find her pony-footing on Great Songwriter Mountain.","She often succeeds in joining the Joni/Carole King tradition of stark-relief emotional mapping .","Her self-discovery project is one of the best stories in pop.","As part of the Red promotional campaign, representatives

Association's annual ceremony.","However, Swift was honored by the Association with a special Pinnacle Award for \"unique\" levels of success; Garth Brooks is the only other recipient.","McGraw, Hill, Urban, Flatts, Strait and Brad Paisley presented Swift with the award, while Mick Jagger, Simon, Julia Roberts, Reese Witherspoon, Ethel Kennedy and Justin Timberlake recorded video messages.","The New York Times considered it an attempt to persuade \"country music's cash cow, its creative engine, its ambassador to the wider world\" to remain within the genre while The New Yorker wondered whether \"it may have been the moment when Swift and the genre that helped steer her toward pop domination said goodbye.","Swift won three MTV Europe Music Awards in 2012, including the honors for

Red era, Swift's romantic life became the subject of intense media scrutiny.","Gawker remarked that Swift had dated \"every man in the universe.\" The Westboro Baptist Church protested Swift's concerts, labelling her \"the whorish face of doomed America,\" while Abercrombie \u0026 Fitch marketed a slogan T-shirt with a \"slut-shaming\" Swift reference.","The New York Times asserted that her \"dating history has begun to stir what feels like the beginning of a backlash\" and questioned whether Swift was in the midst of a \"quarter-life crisis.\" The Village Voice suggested that Swift's embrace of \"traditional femininity\" was the cause of the backlash: \"She's young, she can be contentiously dramatic, she puts herself in the center of her stories, and obviously she's dated a lot of famous people in a relatively short amount of time.","But none of that is exceptionally rare.","The dating issue emerged at the 2013 Golden Globes award ceremony, where comediennes Tina Fey and Amy Poehler made a joke about Swift's serial-dating reputation, with Fey warning her to \"stay away from Michael J.","Fox's son.","I was just sort of like, Oh well, you know, I can laugh at myself.","But what it ended up adding to was this whole kind of everyone jumping on the bandwagon of \"Taylor dates too much\"—which, you know, if you want some big revelation, since 2010 I have dated exactly two people.","Elsewhere in the article, while discussing what the journalist describes as \"the Golden Globes, and mean girls in general,\" Swift approvingly quoted Madeline Albright's remark that \"There's a special place in hell for women who don't help other women.","Swift's fifth studio album, 1989, was released on October 27, 2014.","During the composition period, Swift was inspired by the

best-selling album of 2014, selling 3.","66 million copies, despite only being on sale for nine weeks.","The critical response to 1989 was frequently positive, with TIME's Sam Lansky describing the album as a \"paradigm shift.\" Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone remarked: \"Deeply weird, feverishly emotional, wildly enthusiastic, 1989 sounds exactly like Taylor Swift, even when it sounds like nothing she's ever tried before.\" Alexis Petridis of The Guardian praised the album's \"Springsteenesque narratives of escape and the kind of doomed romantic fatalism in which 60s girl groups dealt … On 1989 the reasons she's afforded the kind of respect denied to her peers are abundantly obvious.","The 1989 World Tour will run from May to December 2015, visiting the US, Canada, the UK, the

Shania, Faith, the Dixie Chicks.\" She was drawn to both the sound and storytelling of country music.","Twain, both as a songwriter and performer, was her biggest musical influence.","Hill was Swift's childhood role model and she told Billboard in 2011, \"... when Faith Hill performed on an awards show, everything mattered—everything she said, did, wore, I tried to copy it.\" Swift admired the Dixie Chicks's defiant attitude and their ability to play their own instruments.","The band's \"Cowboy Take Me Away\" was the first song Swift learned to play on the guitar.","Swift then began to explore the music of older country stars, including Cline, Loretta Lynn, Tammy Wynette and Dolly Parton.","Lynn's \"Fist City\" is one of Swift's favorite country songs.","She believes Parton is \"an amazing example to every female songwriter out there.\" Other mainstream country influences include Miranda Lambert, Dwight Yoakam, Strait, Garth Brooks, Kenny Chesney, Reba McEntire, Jackson, Martina McBride, Rimes, McGraw and Brad Paisley.","Swift also admires alt-country artists such as Ryan Adams, Patty Griffin, Lori McKenna and Bon Iver.","Swift has also been influenced by many artists outside the country genre.","As a pre-teen, she enjoyed bubblegum pop acts including Hanson and Britney Spears.","[citation needed] In her high school years, Swift listened to emo bands such as Dashboard Confessional, Fall Out Boy, The All-American Rejects and Jimmy Eat World.","She was also a fan of contemporary female singer-songwriters including Ingrid Michaelson,[citation needed] Michelle Branch, Pink, Alanis Morissette, Ashlee Simpson, Kelly Clarkson, Fefe Dobson and Avril Lavigne.","Swift closely followed the musical supervision on the television dramas The O.","C.","and Grey's Anatomy, downloading \"every\" song featured.","She is a fan of hip hop music, particularly the rhyming patterns used by artists such as Eminem, stating that \"Pride [in a lifestyle] is something that both country and hip-hop share.\" Swift also drew inspiration from the catalogues of veteran artists.","She describes Nicks as a \"hero\" who \"has inspired me in so many ways.\" Petty, she has said, \"is on a pedestal for me.\" She is \"obsessed\" with Sixties acts like The Shirelles, Doris Troy and The Beach Boys.","Influence also came from older female pop rock singers including Pat Benatar, Melissa Etheridge, Sarah McLachlan, Shawn Colvin and Linda Ronstadt.","Swift lists Paul McCartney, Bruce Springsteen, Emmylou Harris, Kris Kristofferson and Carly Simon as her career role models: \"They've taken chances, but they've also been the same artist for their entire careers.\" McCartney, both as a Beatle and a solo artist, makes Swift feel \"as if I've been let into his heart and his mind\": \"Any musician could only dream of a legacy like that.\" She admires Springsteen because he is \"so musically relevant after such a long period of time.\" She aspires to be like Harris as she grows older: \"It's not about fame for her, it's about music.\" Swift says of Kristofferson: \"He shines in songwriting ... He's just one of those people who has been in this business for years but you can tell it hasn't chewed him up and spat him out.\" She admires Simon's \"songwriting and honesty\": \"She's known as an emotional person but a strong person.","Thematically, The Guardian noted that Swift was \"fantastically good at regarding teenage life with a kind of wistful, sepia-toned nostalgia\" over the course of her first two albums.","New York Magazine remarked that few singer-songwriters have written \"great records so explicitly about their teens ... Her nearest antecedent might be sixties-era Brian Wilson, the one true adolescent auteur before she came along.\" Comparisons have also been drawn with Janis Ian.","Fairytale imagery featured on Swift's second album, Fearless.","She explored the disconnect \"between fairy tales and the reality of love.\" Her later albums address more adult relationships.","In addition to romance and love, Swift's songs have discussed parent-child relationships (\"The Best Day\", \"Never Grow Up\", \"Ronan\"), friendships (\"Fifteen\", \"Breathe\", \"22\", \"Bad Blood\"), alienation (\"The Outside\", \"A Place in This World\", \"Tied Together with a Smile\", \"Mean\", \"Shake It Off\"), the paparazzi (\"The Lucky One\", \"I Know Places\"), and career ambitions (\"Change\", \"Long Live\").","It has been said that Swift's defining quality as a songwriter is \"a determination to register and hang onto fleeting feelings and impressions, a pre-emptive nostalgia for a present (and sometimes even a future) that she knows will some day be in the past.\" Swift frequently includes \"a tossed-off phrase to suggest large and serious things that won't fit in the song, things that enhance or subvert the surface narrative.\" The New Yorker has said that her songs, \"though they are not subversive, have a certain sophistication .","Sentimental songs are laced with intimations of future disillusionment.","Structurally, Slate notes that Swift has \"effortless, preternatural mastery of pop conventions: Very few songwriters can build better bridges than she does.\" Rolling Stone described her as \"a songwriting savant with an intuitive gift for verse-chorus-bridge architecture.\" The Village Voice noted that Swift uses third-verse POV reversals frequently.","In terms of imagery, a large degree of repetition is evident in Swift's songwriting.","In the words of The Guardian, \"she spends so much time kissin' in the rain that it seems a miracle she hasn't developed trenchfoot.\" The writer added, \"to Swift's credit, she explores new lyrical motifs over the course of [her fourth] album.\" American Songwriter describes Swift as \"a great songwriter, who writes with an unmatched and almost unnatural acuity ... Even her earliest material is characterized by thoughtful – perhaps meticulous – word choice and deliberate melodic construction, with nary a lazy rhyme or aimless tune to be found.\" While reviews of Swift's work are \"almost uniformly positive,\" The New Yorker has said she is generally portrayed \"more as a skilled technician than as a Dylanesque visionary.","\"For a female to write about her feelings, and then be portrayed as some clingy, insane, desperate girlfriend in need of making you marry her and have kids with her, I think that's taking something that potentially should be celebrated – a woman writing about her feelings in a confessional way – that's taking it and turning it and twisting it into something that is frankly a little sexist.","Swift uses autobiographical detail in her work.","Listening to music as a child, she felt confused \"when I knew something was going on in someone's personal life and they didn't address it in their music.","The New York Times believes that \"righting wrongs is Ms. Swift's raison d'être.\" In her songs, Swift often addresses the \"anonymous crushes of her high school years\" and, more recently, fellow celebrities.","Mayer, the presumed subject of \"Dear John\", has said the song \"humiliated\" him: \"I think it's kind of cheap songwriting. I know she's the biggest thing in the world, and I'm not trying to sink anybody's ship, but I think it's abusing your talent to rub your hands together and go, 'Wait till he gets a load of this!'\" The Village Voice has downplayed this aspect of Swift's songwriting: \"Being told What Songs Mean is like having a really pushy professor. And it imperils a true appreciation of Swift's talent, which is not confessional, but dramatic.\" New York Magazine believes the media scrutiny over her decision to use autobiographical detail \"is sexist, inasmuch as it's not asked of her male peers\": \"It's a relief to see Swift, the ur-nice-girl, refuse to give the mea culpa that many journalists she's talked to have sought.","The singer herself has said that all her songs are not factual and are often based on observations.","Aside from her liner note clues, Swift tries not to talk specifically about song subjects \"because these are real people. You try to give insight as to where you were coming from as a writer without completely throwing somebody under the bus.\" She lampooned herself while hosting Saturday Night Live for the first time in 2009—in a humorous song she wrote specifically for the episode, entitled \"Monologue Song,\" Swift jokingly sings about the audience expectation that she would write a song about men who have \"cheated\" on her.","In 2014, Swift asserted that it is her personal policy to never use real names in her lyrics.","Swift's music contains elements of pop, pop rock and country.","She self-identified as a country artist until the 2014 release of 1989, which she has described as a \"sonically cohesive pop album.\" Despite the pop direction of 1989, which the singer states was solely her decision and not influenced by anyone else, Swift intends to record further country music albums in the future.","Rolling Stone asserted that, \"she might get played on the country station, but she's one of the few genuine rock stars we've got these days.\" The New York Times noted that, \"There isn't much in Ms. Swift's music to indicate country—a few banjo strums, a pair of cowboy boots worn onstage, a bedazzled guitar—but there's something in her winsome, vulnerable delivery that's unique to Nashville.\" The New Yorker believes she is \"considered part of Nashville's country-pop tradition only because she writes narrative songs with melodic clarity and dramatic shape—Nashville's stock-in-trade.\" The Guardian has said that Swift \"cranks melodies out with the pitiless efficiency of a Scandinavian pop factory.","Swift's voice has been described as \"sweet, but soft.\" In studio recordings, the Los Angeles Times identifies Swift's \"defining\" vocal gesture as \"the line that slides down like a contented sigh or up like a raised eyebrow, giving her beloved girl-time hits their air of easy intimacy.\" Rolling Stone, in a Speak Now review, remarked: \"Swift's voice is unaffected enough to mask how masterful she has become as a singer; she lowers her voice for the payoff lines in the classic mode of a shy girl trying to talk tough.\" In another review of Speak Now, The Village Voice noted that her phrasing was previously \"bland and muddled, but that's changed.","She can still sound strained and thin, and often strays into a pitch that drives some people crazy; but she's learned how to make words sound like what they mean.","In a live setting, Swift, according to The Hollywood Reporter, \"does her best, but certainly doesn't have the pipes to go toe-to-toe with the likes of Christina Aguilera or Carrie Underwood.\" Her live vocals were described in 2009 as \"flat,\" \"thin, and sometimes as wobbly as a newborn colt.\" However, Swift has received praise for refusing to correct her pitch with Auto-Tune.","In an interview with The New Yorker, Swift characterized herself primarily as a songwriter: \"I write songs, and my voice is just a way to get those lyrics across.\" Borchetta conceded in 2010 that Swift is \"not the best technical singer,\" but described her as the \"best communicator that we've got.\" Swift's vocal presence is something that concerns her and she has \"put a lot of work\" into improving it.","It was reported in 2010 that she continues to take vocal lessons.","She has said that she only feels nervous performing \"if I'm not sure what the audience thinks of me, like at award shows.","Swift's artistic principles have progressively developed over the course of her career and have intermittently been publicized.","In a July 2014 Wall Street Journal op-ed, Swift expressed her optimism in regard to the music industry, emphasizing the ongoing importance of albums, the increasing value of social media, and comparing a musician's relationship with fans to that of an intimate partnership.","you should know that you're reading the opinion of an enthusiastic optimist: one of the few living souls in the music industry who still believes that the music industry is not dying … it's just coming alive.","There are many (many) people who predict the downfall of music sales and the irrelevancy of the album as an economic entity.","I am not one of them.","According to Swift, full-length studio albums—as opposed to the singles that consumers can cherry-pick in online stores—continue to be \"based on the amount of heart and soul an artist has bled into a body of work.\" Swift acknowledges that \"Piracy, file sharing and streaming have shrunk the numbers of paid album sales drastically,\" but asserts that \"people are still buying albums, but now they're buying just a few of them.\" Swift explains that consumers now only buy the albums that \"hit them like an arrow through the heart or have made them feel strong or allowed them to feel like they really aren't alone in feeling so alone.","Swift also urges artists, like the \"young girls\" she meets, to recognize their true worth, and hopes \"they don’t underestimate themselves or undervalue their art.\" For Swift, \"Music is art, and art is important and rare. Important, rare things are valuable. Valuable things should be paid for.\" In terms of addressing the increasingly challenging market environment for musicians, Swift highlights the importance of social media—recounting her early MySpace campaigns—the element of surprise, and the need for artists to continually conceive of \"inventive ways of keeping their audiences on their toes.","This moment in music is so exciting because the creative avenues an artist can explore are limitless.","In this moment in music, stepping out of your comfort zone is rewarded, and sonic evolution is not only accepted … it is celebrated.","The only real risk is being too afraid to take a risk at all.","On November 3, 2014, Swift removed her entire catalog—with the exception of a single song—from Spotify after the indications of her disapproval of the streaming business model emerged in the July 2014 op-ed.","Furthermore, she had previously delayed the streaming of her 2012 album, Red.","Spotify immediately launched a social media campaign to persuade Swift to return and, in a statement on its website, claimed that 16 million of over 40 million users had played her music in the preceding 30-day period.","In mid-November, Swift's label head, Scott Borchetta said that Spotify paid Swift a total of $500,000 over the previous 12 months.","Spotify responded to Borchetta, by clarifying that Swift had been paid $2 million for global streaming over the year-long time frame.","Spotify further explained: \"We [Spotify] paid Taylor [Swift]’s label and publisher roughly half a million dollars in the month before she took her catalog down\".","Musician Gene Simmons said in a December 2014 interview: \"What Taylor Swift did is pretty smart. She knows who her fan base is. She took all her stuff off the downloading platforms because she says she isn't getting paid. Why should she work for free?\" Swift and Borchetta both told the media that their action with Spotify was intended to make an impact more broadly.","Swift has high Q Score and Davie-Brown Index ratings, reflecting a high level of public awareness (90 percent) and popularity (80 percent) in the U.","S.","The singer considers it her \"responsibility\" to be conscious of her influence on young fans.","A Rolling Stone journalist who profiled Swift in 2009 remarked upon her polite manners: \"If this is Swift's game face, it must be tattooed on because it never drops.","In 2012, Rolling Stone remarked upon Swift's \"ease with glad-handing ... it's not hard to imagine her running for office someday\" while The Hollywood Reporter described her as \"the Best People Person Since Bill Clinton.\" It has been said that she is \"the kind of driven, intensely ambitious person who'd thrive regardless of her profession.\" A 2012 Vogue cover story described Swift as \"clever and funny and occasionally downright bawdy\" in person.","Grantland describes Swift as \"dorky\" and \"openly neurotic in a way you'd never see from a blonde country princess like Faith Hill or Carrie Underwood.","She is more like Diane Keaton in Annie Hall: overly gracious and eager to please but full of a nonstop, nervous, fluttering energy.","During the period surrounding the release of 1989, Swift gained a reputation for acts of kindness toward her fans that originated on social media.","In addition to the participation of 100 fans in the filming of the \"Shake It Off\" music video and the 1989 Secret Sessions album-listening parties, Swift sent Christmas gifts to a selection of fans by post and in person.","The gift-sending continued in January 2015, and she also continued to assist fans who reached out to her on the Tumblr social media network.","The things that set you apart from the pack, the things that you once thought were your weaknesses will someday become your strengths.","So if they say you're weird or annoying or strange or too this or not enough that, maybe it's because you threaten them.","Maybe you threaten them because you're not the norm.","And if you're not the norm, give yourself a standing ovation.","In the early years of her career, Swift's signature look consisted of sundresses and cowboy boots.","This fashion style is still copied by many of the young fans who attend her concerts.","At formal events, Swift became known for \"sparkly, beaded dresses.\" Her naturally curly hairstyle is replicated by fans, and Swift has remarked: \"I remember straightening my hair because I wanted to be like everybody else, and now the fact that anybody would emulate what I do? It's just funny.\" She was asked by Vogue to cut bangs for a cover shoot in late 2011, and now straightens her hair.","Swift favors retro style, and it has been said that she has the look of \"a nineteen-thirties movie siren ... red lipstick, thick mascara.\" She was named an Icon of American Style by Vogue in 2011.","She has named Françoise Hardy, Jane Birkin, Brigitte Bardot, and Audrey Hepburn as her own style inspirations.","Swift's work has received praise from veteran artists.","Neil Young describes her as \"a great writer\": \"I like Taylor Swift.","I like listening to her.","I kind of like watching her respond to all the attacks.","I like the ways she's defining herself.","So I keep my eye on it.","I'm sorry, that's what you do as a songwriter .","Wear your heart on your sleeve, then just write about it.","Fuck 'em.","If I was young, I would be one of Taylor Swift's conquests because I would stalk her.","James Taylor, who performed with Swift on two occasions, said that \"we just hit it off. I loved her songs, and her presence on stage was so great.\" Elvis Costello remarked: \"I think she is quite interesting ... You can see a degree of self-possession there, and I'm intrigued by that.\" Judy Collins points to Swift as an example of a current star who is continuing on the lineage of being an independent-minded artist.","In regard to Swift, Kristofferson said that \"she blows me away. It's amazing to me that someone so young is writing such great songs. She's got a great career ahead of her.\" Janis Ian notes that Swift \"changed the face of music, songwriting and guitar playing for girls ... There is an authenticity there.\" Nicks believes Swift writes \"songs that make the whole world sing, like Neil Diamond or Elton John.\" She remarked that the younger singer's \"Today Was A Fairytale\" has \"stayed in my heart forever.","And it just reminds me of me in a lot of ways.","Jon Bon Jovi describes her as \"the real deal in every way, shape and form. She's a writer, she's a singer, she's a beautiful girl ... Like, she's going to be around.\" Parton is \"extremely impressed with her, especially with her songwriting ... I'm real impressed with the depth of her sometimes. She's got the qualities that could last a long time.\" Etheridge remarks: \"I love her soul, her spirit.","I think she's going to surprise people and I think she's going to be around for a long time.","Swift has also received songwriting praise from contemporaries.","Mayer was a supporter of Swift's early career—the duo recorded a duet and performed in concert together on two occasions: \"You could put her in a time machine in any era and she would have a hit record.\" She also received praise from Drake, Tegan and Sara, Grimes, Kesha, Katy Perry, Kelly Clarkson and Lady Gaga.","Ryan Adams described her as one of the \"most fucking amazing writers I’ve ever seen. I’ve sat in this room with her before and heard a song she was constructing on the spot and it was unbelievable. It was pure alchemy.” Kathleen Hanna is \"totally into Taylor Swift.","I think she has super-clever lyrics, and I love that she writes her own music.","\" Shirley Manson remarked in February 2010 that Swift is \"exceedingly talented at songwriting .","She drew her own door and walked right through it.","We should applaud her balls for bucking the system.","That's what artists are supposed to do.","\" Lena Dunham, the creator and star of HBO's television series Girls, has described Swift as her \"artistic kindred spirit.","While promoting her debut album, Swift appeared as a spokesmodel

helped the rest of the cast nail the punchlines\".","Proving \"admirably resilient in a wide variety of sketch roles\", she \"inspired more of a female, girly-in-the-best-sense sensibility in SNL than it's shown since the Tina Fey-Amy Poehler days\".","Swift made her feature film acting debut in the 2010 ensemble comedy Valentine's Day, playing the ditzy girlfriend of a high school jock.","The Los

where she attended West Reading Elementary Center and Wyomissing Area Junior/Senior High School.","During early adolescence, Swift became interested in musical theatre.","Swift then turned her attention to country music—Shania Twain's songs made her \"want to just run around the block four times and daydream about everything.\" She spent her weekends performing at local festivals, fairs, coffeehouses, karaoke contests, garden clubs, Boy Scout meetings and sporting events.","At the age of 11, after many failed attempts, Swift won a local talent competition and was given the opportunity

career.","At the age of eleven, she traveled with her mother to Nashville for spring break to submit a demo, of Dolly Parton and Dixie Chicks karaoke covers, with record labels along Music Row.","She received label rejections and realized that \"everyone in that town wanted to do what I wanted to do. So, I kept thinking to myself, I need to figure out a way to be different.\" At the age of twelve, Swift was taught how to play three chords on a guitar, inspiring her to write her first song, \"Lucky You.\" She had previously won a national poetry contest with a poem titled \"Monster in My Closet,\" but now began to focus on songwriting.","In 2003, Swift and her parents started working with New York-based music manager Dan Dymtrow.","With Dymtrow's help, Swift modelled for Abercrombie \u0026 Fitch as part of their \"Rising Stars\" campaign, had an original song included in a Maybelline compilation CD, and attended meetings with major record labels.","After performing original songs at an RCA Records showcase, the eighth-grader was given an artist development deal and began making frequent trips to Nashville with her mother.","My parents took all the pressure off by saying, \"We're just moving because we love the area, so don't worry.\" They knew nothing about the industry and had no involvement in entertainment, but I was obsessed with it and so they did their research and read up about it to help me in every way they could.","In Tennessee, Swift attended Hendersonville High School for her freshman and sophomore years.","Later, to accommodate her touring schedule, Swift transferred to the Aaron Academy, a private Christian school which offered homeschooling services.","She earned her high school diploma in 2008, having completed her final two years of course work in 12 months.","Swift moved to Nashville, Tennessee, at the age of 14.","In 2004, she signed an artist development deal with RCA Records, leading to writing sessions with experienced Music Row songwriters such as Troy Verges, Brett Beavers, Brett James, Mac McAnally and The Warren Brothers.","Rose has said that the sessions were \"some of the easiest I've ever done.

He's just one of those people who has been in this business for years but you can tell it hasn't chewed him up and spat him out.\" She admires Simon's \"songwriting and honesty\": \"She's known as an emotional person but a strong person.","Thematically, The Guardian noted that Swift was \"fantastically good at regarding teenage life with a kind of wistful, sepia-toned nostalgia\" over the course of her first two albums.","New York Magazine remarked that few singer-songwriters have written \"great records so explicitly about their teens ...

And it imperils a true appreciation of Swift's talent, which is not confessional, but dramatic.\" New York Magazine believes the media scrutiny over her decision to use autobiographical detail \"is sexist, inasmuch as it's not asked of her male peers\": \"It's a relief to see Swift, the ur-nice-girl, refuse to give the mea culpa that many journalists she's talked to have sought.","Aside from her liner note clues, Swift tries not to talk specifically about song subjects \"because these are real people. You try to give insight as to where you were coming from as a writer without completely throwing somebody under the bus.\" She lampooned herself while hosting Saturday Night Live for the first time in 2009—in a humorous song she wrote specifically for the episode, entitled \"Monologue Song,\" Swift jokingly sings about the audience expectation that she would write a song about men who have \"cheated\" on her.","In 2014, Swift asserted that it is her personal policy to never use real names in her lyrics.","Swift's music contains elements of pop, pop rock and country.","She self-identified as a country artist until the 2014 release of 1989, which she has described as a \"sonically cohesive pop album.\" Despite the pop direction of 1989, which the singer states was solely her decision and not influenced by anyone else, Swift intends to record further country music albums in the future.","Rolling Stone asserted that, \"she might get played on the country station, but she's one of the few genuine rock stars we've got these days.\" The New York Times noted that, \"There isn't much in Ms. Swift's music to indicate country—a few banjo strums, a pair of cowboy boots worn onstage, a bedazzled guitar—but there's something in her winsome, vulnerable delivery that's unique to Nashville.\" The New Yorker believes she is \"considered part of Nashville's country-pop tradition only because she writes narrative songs with melodic clarity and dramatic shape—Nashville's stock-in-trade.\" The Guardian has said that Swift \"cranks melodies out with the pitiless efficiency of a Scandinavian pop factory.","Swift's voice has been described as \"sweet, but soft.\" In studio recordings, the Los Angeles Times identifies Swift's \"defining\" vocal gesture as \"the line that slides down like a contented sigh or up like a raised eyebrow, giving her beloved girl-time hits their air of easy intimacy.\" Rolling Stone, in a Speak Now review, remarked: \"Swift's voice is unaffected enough to mask how masterful she has become as a singer; she lowers her voice for the payoff lines in the classic mode of a shy girl trying to talk tough.\" In another review of Speak Now, The Village Voice noted that her phrasing was previously \"bland and muddled, but that's changed.","She can still sound strained and thin, and often strays into a pitch that drives some people crazy; but she's learned how to make words sound like what they mean.","In a live setting, Swift, according to The Hollywood Reporter, \"does her best, but certainly doesn't have the pipes to go toe-to-toe with the likes of Christina Aguilera or Carrie Underwood.\" Her live vocals were described in 2009 as \"flat,\" \"thin, and sometimes as wobbly as a newborn colt.\" However, Swift has received praise for refusing to correct her pitch with Auto-Tune.","In an interview with The New Yorker, Swift characterized herself primarily as a songwriter: \"I write songs, and my voice is just a way to get those lyrics across.\" Borchetta conceded in 2010 that Swift is \"not the best technical singer,\" but described her as the \"best communicator that we've got.\" Swift's vocal presence is something that concerns her and she has \"put a lot of work\" into improving it.","She has said that she only feels nervous performing \"if I'm not sure what the audience thinks of me, like at award shows.","In a July 2014 Wall Street Journal op-ed, Swift expressed her optimism in regard to the music industry, emphasizing the ongoing importance of albums, the increasing value of social media, and comparing a musician's relationship with fans to that of an intimate partnership.","According to Swift, full-length studio albums—as opposed to the singles that consumers can cherry-pick in online stores—continue to be \"based on the amount of heart and soul an artist has bled into a body of work.\" Swift acknowledges that \"Piracy, file sharing and streaming have shrunk the numbers of paid album sales drastically,\" but asserts that \"people are still buying albums, but now they're buying just a few of them.\" Swift explains that consumers now only buy the albums that \"hit them like an arrow through the heart or have made them feel strong or allowed them to feel like they really aren't alone in feeling so alone.","Swift also urges artists, like the \"young girls\" she meets, to recognize their true worth, and hopes \"they don’t underestimate themselves or undervalue their art.\" For Swift, \"Music is art, and art is important and rare. Important, rare things are valuable. Valuable things should be paid for.\" In terms of addressing the increasingly challenging market environment for musicians, Swift highlights the importance of social media—recounting her early MySpace campaigns—the element of surprise, and the need for artists to continually conceive of \"inventive ways of keeping their audiences on their toes.","In this moment in music, stepping out of your comfort zone is rewarded, and sonic evolution is not only accepted … it is celebrated.","On November 3, 2014, Swift removed her entire catalog—with the exception of a single song—from Spotify after the indications of her disapproval of the streaming business model emerged in the July 2014 op-ed.","Furthermore, she had previously delayed the streaming of her 2012 album, Red.","Spotify immediately launched a social media campaign to persuade Swift to return and, in a statement on its website, claimed that 16 million of over 40 million users had played her music in the preceding 30-day period.","In mid-November, Swift's label head, Scott Borchetta said that Spotify paid Swift a total of $500,000 over the previous 12 months.","Spotify responded to Borchetta, by clarifying that Swift had been paid $2 million for global streaming over the year-long time frame.","Swift has high Q Score and Davie-Brown Index ratings, reflecting a high level of public awareness (90 percent) and popularity (80 percent) in the U.","A Rolling Stone journalist who profiled Swift in 2009 remarked upon her polite manners: \"If this is Swift's game face, it must be tattooed on because it never drops.","In 2012, Rolling Stone remarked upon Swift's \"ease with glad-handing ... it's not hard to imagine her running for office someday\" while The Hollywood Reporter described her as \"the Best People Person Since Bill Clinton.\" It has been said that she is \"the kind of driven, intensely ambitious person who'd thrive regardless of her profession.\" A 2012 Vogue cover story described Swift as \"clever and funny and occasionally downright bawdy\" in person.","She is more like Diane Keaton in Annie Hall: overly gracious and eager to please but full of a nonstop, nervous, fluttering energy.","During the period surrounding the release of 1989, Swift gained a reputation for acts of kindness toward her fans that originated on social media.","In addition to the participation of 100 fans in the filming of the \"Shake It Off\" music video and the 1989 Secret Sessions album-listening parties, Swift sent Christmas gifts to a selection of fans by post and in person.","The gift-sending continued in January 2015, and she also continued to assist fans who reached out to her on the Tumblr social media network.","The things that set you apart from the pack, the things that you once thought were your weaknesses will someday become your strengths.","So if they say you're weird or annoying or strange or too this or not enough that, maybe it's because you threaten them.","And if you're not the norm, give yourself a standing ovation.","In the early years of her career, Swift's signature look consisted of sundresses and cowboy boots.","At formal events, Swift became known for \"sparkly, beaded dresses.\" Her naturally curly hairstyle is replicated by fans, and Swift has remarked: \"I remember straightening my hair because I wanted to be like everybody else, and now the fact that anybody would emulate what I do? It's just funny.\" She was asked by Vogue to cut bangs for a cover shoot in late 2011, and now straightens her hair.","Swift favors retro style, and it has been said that she has the look of \"a nineteen-thirties movie siren ... red lipstick, thick mascara.\" She was named an Icon of American Style by Vogue in 2011.","She has named Françoise Hardy, Jane Birkin, Brigitte Bardot, and Audrey Hepburn as her own style inspirations.","I'm sorry, that's what you do as a songwriter .","Wear your heart on your sleeve, then just write about it.","If I was young, I would be one of Taylor Swift's conquests because I would stalk her.","James Taylor, who performed with Swift on two occasions, said that \"we just hit it off.

It's amazing to me that someone so young is writing such great songs.

There is an authenticity there.\" Nicks believes Swift writes \"songs that make the whole world sing, like Neil Diamond or Elton John.\" She remarked that the younger singer's \"Today Was A Fairytale\" has \"stayed in my heart forever.","Jon Bon Jovi describes her as \"the real deal in every way, shape and form.

I'm real impressed with the depth of her sometimes.

Shania, Faith, the Dixie Chicks.\" She was drawn to both the sound and storytelling of country music.","Hill was Swift's childhood role model and she told Billboard in 2011, \"... when Faith Hill performed on an awards show, everything mattered—everything she said, did, wore, I tried to copy it.\" Swift admired the Dixie Chicks's defiant attitude and their ability to play their own instruments.","The band's \"Cowboy Take Me Away\" was the first song Swift learned to play on the guitar.","Lynn's \"Fist City\" is one of Swift's favorite country songs.","She believes Parton is \"an amazing example to every female songwriter out there.\" Other mainstream country influences include Miranda Lambert, Dwight Yoakam, Strait, Garth Brooks, Kenny Chesney, Reba McEntire, Jackson, Martina McBride, Rimes, McGraw and Brad Paisley.","and Grey's Anatomy, downloading \"every\" song featured.","She is a fan of hip hop music, particularly the rhyming patterns used by artists such as Eminem, stating that \"Pride [in a lifestyle] is something that both country and hip-hop share.\" Swift also drew inspiration from the catalogues of veteran artists.","She describes Nicks as a \"hero\" who \"has inspired me in so many ways.\" Petty, she has said, \"is on a pedestal for me.\" She is \"obsessed\" with Sixties acts like The Shirelles, Doris Troy and The Beach Boys.","Swift lists Paul McCartney, Bruce Springsteen, Emmylou Harris, Kris Kristofferson and Carly Simon as her career role models: \"They've taken chances, but they've also been the same artist for their entire careers.\" McCartney, both as a Beatle and a solo artist, makes Swift feel \"as if I've been let into his heart and his mind\": \"Any musician could only dream of a legacy like that.\" She admires Springsteen because he is \"so musically relevant after such a long period of time.\" She aspires to be like Harris as she grows older: \"It's not about fame for her, it's about music.\" Swift says of Kristofferson: \"He shines in songwriting ... He's just one of those people who has been in this business for years but you can tell it hasn't chewed him up and spat him out.\" She admires Simon's \"songwriting and honesty\": \"She's known as an emotional person but a strong person.","Thematically, The Guardian noted that Swift was \"fantastically good at regarding teenage life with a kind of wistful, sepia-toned nostalgia\" over the course of her first two albums.","New York Magazine remarked that few singer-songwriters have written \"great records so explicitly about their teens ... Her nearest antecedent might be sixties-era Brian Wilson, the one true adolescent auteur before she came along.\" Comparisons have also been drawn with Janis Ian.","She explored the disconnect \"between fairy tales and the reality of love.\" Her later albums address more adult relationships.","In addition to romance and love, Swift's songs have discussed parent-child relationships (\"The Best Day\", \"Never Grow Up\", \"Ronan\"), friendships (\"Fifteen\", \"Breathe\", \"22\", \"Bad Blood\"), alienation (\"The Outside\", \"A Place in This World\", \"Tied Together with a Smile\", \"Mean\", \"Shake It Off\"), the paparazzi (\"The Lucky One\", \"I Know Places\"), and career ambitions (\"Change\", \"Long Live\").","It has been said that Swift's defining quality as a songwriter is \"a determination to register and hang onto fleeting feelings and impressions, a pre-emptive nostalgia for a present (and sometimes even a future) that she knows will some day be in the past.\" Swift frequently includes \"a tossed-off phrase to suggest large and serious things that won't fit in the song, things that enhance or subvert the surface narrative.\" The New Yorker has said that her songs, \"though they are not subversive, have a certain sophistication .","Structurally, Slate notes that Swift has \"effortless, preternatural mastery of pop conventions: Very few songwriters can build better bridges than she does.\" Rolling Stone described her as \"a songwriting savant with an intuitive gift for verse-chorus-bridge architecture.\" The Village Voice noted that Swift uses third-verse POV reversals frequently.","In the words of The Guardian, \"she spends so much time kissin' in the rain that it seems a miracle she hasn't developed trenchfoot.\" The writer added, \"to Swift's credit, she explores new lyrical motifs over the course of [her fourth] album.\" American Songwriter describes Swift as \"a great songwriter, who writes with an unmatched and almost unnatural acuity ... Even her earliest material is characterized by thoughtful – perhaps meticulous – word choice and deliberate melodic construction, with nary a lazy rhyme or aimless tune to be found.\" While reviews of Swift's work are \"almost uniformly positive,\" The New Yorker has said she is generally portrayed \"more as a skilled technician than as a Dylanesque visionary.","\"For a female to write about her feelings, and then be portrayed as some clingy, insane, desperate girlfriend in need of making you marry her and have kids with her, I think that's taking something that potentially should be celebrated – a woman writing about her feelings in a confessional way – that's taking it and turning it and twisting it into something that is frankly a little sexist.","Listening to music as a child, she felt confused \"when I knew something was going on in someone's personal life and they didn't address it in their music.","The New York Times believes that \"righting wrongs is Ms. Swift's raison d'être.\" In her songs, Swift often addresses the \"anonymous crushes of her high school years\" and, more recently, fellow celebrities.","Mayer, the presumed subject of \"Dear John\", has said the song \"humiliated\" him: \"I think it's kind of cheap songwriting. I know she's the biggest thing in the world, and I'm not trying to sink anybody's ship, but I think it's abusing your talent to rub your hands together and go, 'Wait till he gets a load of this!'\" The Village Voice has downplayed this aspect of Swift's songwriting: \"Being told What Songs Mean is like having a really pushy professor. And it imperils a true appreciation of Swift's talent, which is not confessional, but dramatic.\" New York Magazine believes the media scrutiny over her decision to use autobiographical detail \"is sexist, inasmuch as it's not asked of her male peers\": \"It's a relief to see Swift, the ur-nice-girl, refuse to give the mea culpa that many journalists she's talked to have sought.","Aside from her liner note clues, Swift tries not to talk specifically about song subjects \"because these are real people. You try to give insight as to where you were coming from as a writer without completely throwing somebody under the bus.\" She lampooned herself while hosting Saturday Night Live for the first time in 2009—in a humorous song she wrote specifically for the episode, entitled \"Monologue Song,\" Swift jokingly sings about the audience expectation that she would write a song about men who have \"cheated\" on her.","She self-identified as a country artist until the 2014 release of 1989, which she has described as a \"sonically cohesive pop album.\" Despite the pop direction of 1989, which the singer states was solely her decision and not influenced by anyone else, Swift intends to record further country music albums in the future.","Rolling Stone asserted that, \"she might get played on the country station, but she's one of the few genuine rock stars we've got these days.\" The New York Times noted that, \"There isn't much in Ms. Swift's music to indicate country—a few banjo strums, a pair of cowboy boots worn onstage, a bedazzled guitar—but there's something in her winsome, vulnerable delivery that's unique to Nashville.\" The New Yorker believes she is \"considered part of Nashville's country-pop tradition only because she writes narrative songs with melodic clarity and dramatic shape—Nashville's stock-in-trade.\" The Guardian has said that Swift \"cranks melodies out with the pitiless efficiency of a Scandinavian pop factory.","Swift's voice has been described as \"sweet, but soft.\" In studio recordings, the Los Angeles Times identifies Swift's \"defining\" vocal gesture as \"the line that slides down like a contented sigh or up like a raised eyebrow, giving her beloved girl-time hits their air of easy intimacy.\" Rolling Stone, in a Speak Now review, remarked: \"Swift's voice is unaffected enough to mask how masterful she has become as a singer; she lowers her voice for the payoff lines in the classic mode of a shy girl trying to talk tough.\" In another review of Speak Now, The Village Voice noted that her phrasing was previously \"bland and muddled, but that's changed.","In a live setting, Swift, according to The Hollywood Reporter, \"does her best, but certainly doesn't have the pipes to go toe-to-toe with the likes of Christina Aguilera or Carrie Underwood.\" Her live vocals were described in 2009 as \"flat,\" \"thin, and sometimes as wobbly as a newborn colt.\" However, Swift has received praise for refusing to correct her pitch with Auto-Tune.","In an interview with The New Yorker, Swift characterized herself primarily as a songwriter: \"I write songs, and my voice is just a way to get those lyrics across.\" Borchetta conceded in 2010 that Swift is \"not the best technical singer,\" but described her as the \"best communicator that we've got.\" Swift's vocal presence is something that concerns her and she has \"put a lot of work\" into improving it.","She has said that she only feels nervous performing \"if I'm not sure what the audience thinks of me, like at award shows.","According to Swift, full-length studio albums—as opposed to the singles that consumers can cherry-pick in online stores—continue to be \"based on the amount of heart and soul an artist has bled into a body of work.\" Swift acknowledges that \"Piracy, file sharing and streaming have shrunk the numbers of paid album sales drastically,\" but asserts that \"people are still buying albums, but now they're buying just a few of them.\" Swift explains that consumers now only buy the albums that \"hit them like an arrow through the heart or have made them feel strong or allowed them to feel like they really aren't alone in feeling so alone.","Swift also urges artists, like the \"young girls\" she meets, to recognize their true worth, and hopes \"they don’t underestimate themselves or undervalue their art.\" For Swift, \"Music is art, and art is important and rare. Important, rare things are valuable. Valuable things should be paid for.\" In terms of addressing the increasingly challenging market environment for musicians, Swift highlights the importance of social media—recounting her early MySpace campaigns—the element of surprise, and the need for artists to continually conceive of \"inventive ways of keeping their audiences on their toes.","Spotify further explained: \"We [Spotify] paid Taylor [Swift]’s label and publisher roughly half a million dollars in the month before she took her catalog down\".","Musician Gene Simmons said in a December 2014 interview: \"What Taylor Swift did is pretty smart. She knows who her fan base is. She took all her stuff off the downloading platforms because she says she isn't getting paid. Why should she work for free?\" Swift and Borchetta both told the media that their action with Spotify was intended to make an impact more broadly.","The singer considers it her \"responsibility\" to be conscious of her influence on young fans.","A Rolling Stone journalist who profiled Swift in 2009 remarked upon her polite manners: \"If this is Swift's game face, it must be tattooed on because it never drops.","In 2012, Rolling Stone remarked upon Swift's \"ease with glad-handing ... it's not hard to imagine her running for office someday\" while The Hollywood Reporter described her as \"the Best People Person Since Bill Clinton.\" It has been said that she is \"the kind of driven, intensely ambitious person who'd thrive regardless of her profession.\" A 2012 Vogue cover story described Swift as \"clever and funny and occasionally downright bawdy\" in person.","Grantland describes Swift as \"dorky\" and \"openly neurotic in a way you'd never see from a blonde country princess like Faith Hill or Carrie Underwood.","In addition to the participation of 100 fans in the filming of the \"Shake It Off\" music video and the 1989 Secret Sessions album-listening parties, Swift sent Christmas gifts to a selection of fans by post and in person.","At formal events, Swift became known for \"sparkly, beaded dresses.\" Her naturally curly hairstyle is replicated by fans, and Swift has remarked: \"I remember straightening my hair because I wanted to be like everybody else, and now the fact that anybody would emulate what I do? It's just funny.\" She was asked by Vogue to cut bangs for a cover shoot in late 2011, and now straightens her hair.","Swift favors retro style, and it has been said that she has the look of \"a nineteen-thirties movie siren ... red lipstick, thick mascara.\" She was named an Icon of American Style by Vogue in 2011.","Neil Young describes her as \"a great writer\": \"I like Taylor Swift.","James Taylor, who performed with Swift on two occasions, said that \"we just hit it off. I loved her songs, and her presence on stage was so great.\" Elvis Costello remarked: \"I think she is quite interesting ... You can see a degree of self-possession there, and I'm intrigued by that.\" Judy Collins points to Swift as an example of a current star who is continuing on the lineage of being an independent-minded artist.","In regard to Swift, Kristofferson said that \"she blows me away. It's amazing to me that someone so young is writing such great songs. She's got a great career ahead of her.\" Janis Ian notes that Swift \"changed the face of music, songwriting and guitar playing for girls ... There is an authenticity there.\" Nicks believes Swift writes \"songs that make the whole world sing, like Neil Diamond or Elton John.\" She remarked that the younger singer's \"Today Was A Fairytale\" has \"stayed in my heart forever.","Jon Bon Jovi describes her as \"the real deal in every way, shape and form. She's a writer, she's a singer, she's a beautiful girl ... Like, she's going to be around.\" Parton is \"extremely impressed with her, especially with her songwriting ... I'm real impressed with the depth of her sometimes. She's got the qualities that could last a long time.\" Etheridge remarks: \"I love her soul, her spirit.","Mayer was a supporter of Swift's early career—the duo recorded a duet and performed in concert together on two occasions: \"You could put her in a time machine in any era and she would have a hit record.\" She also received praise from Drake, Tegan and Sara, Grimes, Kesha, Katy Perry, Kelly Clarkson and Lady Gaga.","Ryan Adams described her as one of the \"most fucking amazing writers I’ve ever seen. I’ve sat in this room with her before and heard a song she was constructing on the spot and it was unbelievable. It was pure alchemy.” Kathleen Hanna is \"totally into Taylor Swift.","\" Shirley Manson remarked in February 2010 that Swift is \"exceedingly talented at songwriting .","\" Lena Dunham, the creator and star of HBO's television series Girls, has described Swift as her \"artistic kindred spirit.","The New York Times noted that the character allowed Swift to be \"a little bit naughty, and credibly so\".","Rolling Stone felt she \"held her own\" and \"does a good job with the script\" while the Chicago Tribune said she \"acquits herself well.\" Later that year, Swift both hosted and performed as the musical guest for an episode of Saturday Night Live.","Entertainment Weekly described her as \"this season's best Saturday Night Live host so far,\" noting that she \"was always up for the challenge, seemed to be having fun, and helped the rest of the cast nail the punchlines\".","Proving \"admirably resilient in a wide variety of sketch roles\", she \"inspired more of a female, girly-in-the-best-sense sensibility in SNL than it's shown since the Tina Fey-Amy Poehler days\".","The Los Angeles Times felt the performance suggested \"serious comedic potential\" while the San Francisco Chronicle found her \"very funny\".","Time remarked that Swift portrayed her character \"rather charmingly\".","However, Variety found her \"entirely undirected... she needs to find a skilled director to tamp her down and channel her obviously abundant energy\".","The Daily News described her performance as \"painfully clunky\" while Slant Magazine found her \"unwatchable\".","In 2012, Michelle Obama presented Swift with The Big Help Award for her \"dedication to helping others\" and \"inspiring others through action.\" Also that year, Kerry Kennedy of the Robert F.","Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights presented Swift with the Ripple of Hope Award because of her \"dedication to advocacy at such a young age .","The space includes three classrooms and an exhibit

reading\" in a second live Scholastic webcast, broadcast directly to US classrooms.","Also that year, she donated all proceeds from her song \"Welcome to New York\" to New York City Public Schools.","On the first anniversary of King's death, Swift told Seventeen that her parents taught her \"never to judge others based on whom they love, what color their skin is, or their religion.\" In 2011, the music video for Swift's anti-bullying song \"Mean\" dealt in part with homophobia in high schools; the video was later nominated for an MTV VMA social activism award.","The New York Times believes she is part of \"a new wave of young (and mostly straight) women who are providing the soundtrack for a generation of gay fans coming to terms with their identity in a time of turbulent and

proud\" of the autonomy that underpinned the change of residence.","Swift asserted: \"There was absolutely no-one else influencing me.","Swift said that she felt \"happy,\" \"free\" and

not \"use other relationships as a band-aid if one doesn't work.","She stated: \"I don't think it's my job to try and influence people which way they should vote.\" Following President Obama's

Tuesday afternoon after school.","The remaining unjust-enrichment claim was settled out of court.","It was his first time recording a studio album but Swift felt they had the right \"chemistry.\" Swift wrote three of the album's songs alone, including two singles, and co-wrote the remaining eight with a team of writers including Rose, Robert Ellis Orrall and Angelo Petraglia.","Musically, the album has been described as \"a mix of trad-country instruments and spry rock guitars.","The New York Times described it as \"a small masterpiece of pop-minded country, both wide-eyed and cynical,

\"insanely hooky sing-song melody that's as Britney as it is Patsy.","Swift, a self-described \"kid of the internet,\" used Myspace to build a fanbase.","This was, at the time, \"revolutionary in

songs \"overlong and overworked\" but remarked that \"they evince an effort that bears a remarkable resemblance to care—that is, to caring in the best, broadest, and most emotional sense.\" Rolling Stone described Swift as one of the best songwriters in \"pop, rock or country\": \"Swift might be a clever Nashville pro who knows all the hitmaking tricks, but she's also a high-strung,

on his end-of-year list, characterizing it as the album on which Swift \"stops pretending she's anything but a pop megastar, one with grown-up concerns, like how two bodies speak to each other and how taste in records can be a stand-in for moral turpitude.\" The Times praised her \"sublime\" lyrics, particularly those on the \"brooding\" \"All Too Well\".","Rolling Stone enjoyed \"watching Swift find her pony-footing on Great Songwriter Mountain.","She often succeeds in joining the Joni/Carole King tradition of stark-relief emotional mapping .","Her self-discovery project is one of the best

backlash\" and questioned whether Swift was in the midst of a \"quarter-life crisis.\" The Village Voice suggested that Swift's embrace of \"traditional femininity\" was the cause of the backlash: \"She's young, she can be contentiously dramatic, she puts herself in the center of her stories, and obviously she's dated a lot of famous people in a relatively short amount of time.","The dating

I know she's the biggest thing in the world, and I'm not trying to sink anybody's ship, but I think it's abusing your talent to rub your hands together and go, 'Wait till he gets a load of this!'\" The Village Voice has downplayed this aspect of Swift's songwriting: \"Being told What Songs Mean is like having a really pushy professor.

she lowers her voice for the payoff lines in the classic mode of a shy girl trying to talk tough.\" In another review of Speak Now, The Village Voice noted that her phrasing was previously \"bland and muddled, but that's changed.","In a live setting, Swift, according to The Hollywood Reporter, \"does her best, but certainly doesn't have the pipes to go toe-to-toe with the likes of Christina Aguilera or Carrie Underwood.\" Her live vocals were described in 2009 as \"flat,\" \"thin, and sometimes as wobbly as a newborn colt.\" However, Swift has received praise for refusing to correct her pitch with Auto-Tune.","In a July 2014 Wall Street Journal op-ed, Swift expressed her optimism in regard to the music industry, emphasizing the ongoing importance of albums, the increasing value of social media, and comparing a musician's relationship with fans to that of an intimate partnership.","According to Swift, full-length studio albums—as opposed to the singles that consumers can cherry-pick in online stores—continue to be \"based on the amount of heart and soul an artist has bled into a body of work.\" Swift acknowledges that \"Piracy, file sharing and streaming have shrunk the numbers of paid album sales drastically,\" but asserts that \"people are still buying albums, but now they're buying just a few of them.\" Swift explains that consumers now only buy the albums that \"hit them like an arrow through the heart or have made them feel strong or allowed them to feel like they really aren't alone in feeling so alone.","On November 3, 2014, Swift removed her entire catalog—with the exception of a single song—from Spotify after the indications of her disapproval of the streaming business model emerged in the July 2014 op-ed.","Spotify immediately launched a social media campaign to persuade Swift to return and, in a statement on its website, claimed that 16 million of over 40 million users had played her music in the preceding 30-day period.","In mid-November, Swift's label head, Scott Borchetta said that Spotify paid Swift a total of $500,000 over the previous 12 months.","Spotify responded to Borchetta, by clarifying that Swift had been paid $2 million for global streaming over the year-long time frame.","Swift has high Q Score and Davie-Brown Index ratings, reflecting a high level of public awareness (90 percent) and popularity (80 percent) in the U.","In 2012, Rolling Stone remarked upon Swift's \"ease with glad-handing ... it's not hard to imagine her running for office someday\" while The Hollywood Reporter described her as \"the Best People Person Since Bill Clinton.\" It has been said that she is \"the kind of driven, intensely ambitious person who'd thrive regardless of her profession.\" A 2012 Vogue cover story described Swift as \"clever and funny and occasionally downright bawdy\" in person.","In addition to the participation of 100 fans in the filming of the \"Shake It Off\" music video and the 1989 Secret Sessions album-listening parties, Swift sent Christmas gifts to a selection of fans by post and in person.","The gift-sending continued in January 2015, and she also continued to assist fans who reached out to her on the Tumblr social media network.","Swift favors retro style, and it has been said that she has the look of \"a nineteen-thirties movie siren ... red lipstick, thick mascara.\" She was named an Icon of American Style by Vogue in 2011.","James Taylor, who performed with Swift on two occasions, said that \"we just hit it off.

recording to spread out between September 1999 and April–May 2000.","In March 1999, Coldplay began work on their debut album, recorded at Rockfield Studios, Matrix Studios, and Wessex Sound Studios with producer Ken Nelson, although the majority of Parachutes' tracks were recorded at Liverpool's Parr Street Studios.","The band worked in three studio rooms at Parr Street, and tracked much of the album in one of these rooms—the project studio which Nelson describes as \"basically a demo room\".","The album was mixed by American engineer Michael Brauer in New York.","Coldplay's record label had originally intended to use a mixing engineer for the tracks they picked as singles, but eventually hired Brauer to work on all songs for the album.","During that period, they played on the Carling

coming.","The band wrote more than 20 songs for the album.","Some of their new material, including \"In My Place\" and \"Animals\", was played live while the band were still touring Parachutes.","The
